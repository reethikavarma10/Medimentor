## Overview 

The **Prediction of Medicine by Symptoms** project is a simple yet effective web-based tool designed to help users identify potential medicines based on their symptoms. The goal is to provide a quick and easy way for individuals to get medicine recommendations before consulting a healthcare professional.  

This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create a clean and user-friendly interface. Users can enter their symptoms, and the system suggests possible medicines from a predefined dataset. While this is not a substitute for professional medical advice, it serves as an initial reference for common illnesses and remedies.
